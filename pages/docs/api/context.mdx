# The context api

With `fnapi`, you can easily define functions.
But for perfect IDE experience, we use native syntax for declaring functions and import them using original import path.

But this has a problem.
See the code below.

```ts
import { FnApi } from "@fnapi/api";

export default class TodoApi {
  @FnApi
  static async list() {
    // We need DB
  }
}
```

We cannot add parameters, because if so typescript intellisense will try to fill the arguments.
So we need a way to provide a db connection to `list` method above, without adding them to parameter nor class fields, also for IntelliSense.

---

We use quite novel approach for this problem.
See the code below.

```ts
import { FnApi, Context } from "@fnapi/api";
import { Db } from "./your-db";

export default class TodoApi {
  @FnApi
  static async list() {
    // We need DB
    const db = Context.get<Db>();
  }
}
```

If you are an experienced TypeScript developer, you may got shocked.
`<Db>` part of `Context.get<Db>()` should be compiled as `Context::get()`, right?
No.
It's how `tsc` compiles your code.
`fnapi` has some compiler passes to allow finding those types in runtime.

## Limits

- `Context::get()` is not allowed. You have to specify full type.

- Currently `Context::get` only supports classes

(Maybe fixed in future)
