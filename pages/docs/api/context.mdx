## The context api

With `fnapi`, you can easily define functnios.
But for perfect IDE experience, we use native syntax for declaring functnios and import them using original import path.

But this has a problem.
See the code below.

```ts
import { FnApi } from "@fnapi/api";

export default class TodoApi {
  @FnApi
  static async list(): Promise<TodoItem[]> {
    // We need DB
  }
}
```

We cannot add paramters, because if so typescript intellisense will try to fill the arguments.
So we need a way to provide a db connection to `list` method above, without adding them to paramter nor class fields, also for intellisense.

We use quite novel approach for this problem.
See the code below.

```ts
import { FnApi, Context, provide } from "@fnapi/api";
import { Db } from "./your-db";

export default class TodoApi {
  @FnApi
  static async list(): Promise<TodoItem[]> {
    // We need DB
    const db = Context.get(DbProvider);
  }
}

/**
 * Type: Provider<Db>
 */
const DbProvider = provide(async (req, res) => {
  // get connection from somewhere
  return new Db();
});
```

This is a bit tricky, because `Context.get` is a static method call, which is processed by the compiler.

## Providing instances of types

You can use `provide` to create a provider.

```ts
import { provide } from "@fnapi/api";
import { Db } from "./your-db";

/**
 * Type: Provider<Db>
 */
const DbProvider = provide(async (req, res) => {
  // get connection from somewhere
  return new Db();
});
```
