# How it works

FnApi depends on static analysis of the API files.

The idea is that, the input / output of an api is statically analyzable in almost all cases.
Actually, this is widely accepted idea.
While calling one api, you expect the sucesssful output to have similar form - i.e. same type - as without such garuntee rest api become too hard to use.

We can use this fact to eliminate the all boilerplates.
The boilerplates includes communication via protocols like http, serialization, deserialization, session management and many more.
Combined with expressiveness of TypeScript type system, we can create the concept of inputs and outputs.
