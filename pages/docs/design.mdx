# The Design

FnApi depends on static analysis of the API files.

The idea is that, the input / output of an api is statically analyzable in almost all cases.
Actually, this is widely accepted idea.
While calling one api, you expect the successful output to have a same type - although it can be a union - as without such guarantee api become too hard to use.

We can use this fact to eliminate all of the boilerplate.
The boilerplate includes communications via protocols like HTTP, serialization, deserialization, session management and many more.
Combined with expressiveness of TypeScript type system, we can represent all requirements of an API using a method.

## Example

Let's take a look at the following example:

```ts
class ProductApi {
  async searchProducts(session: Session, query: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    return await dbQuery();
  }
}
```

Clearly, we can see that the input of this method is a session and a query.
The output is a promise of a list of products.

But problem of calling this is the fact that this is an instance method of a class exists on server.
To call it, we used to create REST / GraphQL API endpoints and call this method from the endpoint.

**But why?**
This boilerplate is **not** necessary.
After all, we **know all inputs, and outputs**.
Using this part, we can generate a client for this api.

Of course, there's session and database connection. Also it requires an instance of `ProductApi`.
But it's still possible to create a client for this API, and even, **we can use identical API for the client!**.
In other words, you can call it from client, and it will work.
Yeah, this **identical API part requires a little magic, but the benefit of the magic is complete elimination of boilerplate**.

## The first magic: Perfect IDE experience

Our goal is providing an identical API for the client, so you, the user of FnApi can call a remote function just like a local asynchronous function.
Let's change the above example a bit.

```ts
// fnapi/product.ts

export default class ProductApi {
  static async searchProducts(query: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    // We need a way to get session
    return await dbQuery();
  }
}
```

We exported it from the module as a default export.

So... IDE will show `ProductApi` in autocompletion, and if you select it, you can do `ProductApi.searchProducts(query)`.
Instead of what?
Sending an _untyped_ HTTP request to the server.
Also with perfect autocompletion of the IDE.

How does it work?
We provide various plugins for each bundlers.
`import` of FnApi api file will be automatically replaced with an asynchronous, generated client.

This is the first magic.
But we have to handle session, right?
This is where the second magic kicks in.

## The second magic: Identical API

Where should we get the session from?
JWT token?
If so client can pass it each time, but as we are talking about a way to support other use-cases while eliminating boilerplate, so let's say, it's a cookie-based session.

Clearly, client cannot pass it.
If it can, you are doing something wrong.
And if the api has `session: Session` in its parameters, editor experience will not be good enough, because `tsc` wants user to fill `session` field.
Instead of adding parameters, we can use some magic here.

```ts
// fnapi/product.ts

import { Context } from "@fnapi/api";

export default class ProductApi {
  static async searchProducts(query: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    const session = Context.get<Session>();
    return await dbQuery();
  }
}
```

You can see that we are using `Context` to get the session.
If you are experienced TypeScript developer, you may got shocked.

> How is it possible?

> > TypeScript generics in runtime?

But this question overlooks one very important thing.
You can process typescript files before stripping types out.
Yeah, this is definitely not a common approach.
But there's nothing holding us from this.
This API is much more stable than APIs based on legacy, stage 2, decorators.
