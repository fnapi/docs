# How it works

FnApi depends on static analysis of the API files.

The idea is that, the input / output of an api is statically analyzable in almost all cases.
Actually, this is widely accepted idea.
While calling one api, you expect the sucesssful output to have a same type - although it can be a union - as without such garuntee api become too hard to use.

We can use this fact to eliminate the all boilerplates.
The boilerplates includes communications via protocols like http, serialization, deserialization, session management and many more.
Combined with expressiveness of TypeScript type system, we can represent all requirements of an api using a method.

## Example

Let's take a look at the following example:

```ts
class ProductApi {
  async searchProducts(session: Sesssion, query: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    return await dbQuery();
  }
}
```

Clearly, we can see that the input of this method is a session and a query.
The output is a promise of a list of products.

But problem of calling this is the fact that this is an instance method of a class exists on server.
To call it, we used to create rest / graphql api endpoints and call this method from the endpoint.

**But why?**
This boilerplates are **not** necessary.
After all, we **know all inputs, and outputs**.
Using this part, we can generate a client for this api.

Of course, there's session and database conncetion. Also it requires an instance of `ProductApi`.
But it's still possible to create a client for this api, and even, **we can use identical api for the client!**.
In other words, you can call it from client, and it will work.
Yeah, this **identical api part requires a magic, but the benefit of the magic is complete eliminatation of boilerplates**.

## The first magic: Perfect IDE experience

Our goal is providing an identical api for the client, so you, the user of FnApi can call a remote function just like a local asynchornous function.
Let's change the above example a bit.

```ts
// fnapi/product.ts

export default class ProductApi {
  static async searchProducts(query: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    // We need a way to get session
    return await dbQuery();
  }
}
```

We exported it from the module as a default export.

So... IDE will show `ProductApi` in autocompletion, and if you select it, you can do `ProductApi.searchProducts(query)`.
Instead of what?
Sending an _untyped_ http request to the server.
Also with perfect autocompletion of the IDE.

How does it work?
We provide various plugins for each bundlers.
`import` of FnApi api file will be automatically replaced with an asynchornous, generated client.

This is the first magic.
But we have to handle session, right?
This is where the second magic kicks in.

## The second magic: Identical api
